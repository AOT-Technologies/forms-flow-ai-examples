# Custom Components
One of the more powerful features of the forms-flow.ai platform is the ability to develop your custom form components. The procedure of creating a custom component involves extending a base class of the component that is closest to the implementation you desire, and then override the methods or add new methods that will implement your custom logic. All of the existing components within the platform also use this same method, so you can see many examples by inspecting how the base components for the Forms-flow renderer are implemented.

This repository contains some code base for implementing custom components, thus we may add additional components using the custom component feature.
